# State Round Tips, Tricks, and Strategies
With the upcoming threat of state round, many cyberpatriot competitors may feel overwhelmed or stumped on what they should do. In this quick guide, I will discuss some tips you can implement with no practice as well as others you may implement for future rounds that take some preparation.

## What to expect
State Round comes with a large jump in difficulty compared to Round 2 and Round 1 in all aspects. While I can't tell you exactly what to expect due to Cyberpatriot's strict rules, I can give you some strategies you can try and implement yourself. 

### Critical Services
In terms of critical services, you will want to come prepared with premade configuration files. You may not be able to expect what these critical services will be but you can still try and mess around with common critical services in real world infrastructure like web servers and FTP servers. An important aspect of learning and competing is adapting.
<br>
In cyberpatriot terms, adapting is actively researching and learning during the competition. Look up the settings in critical service configuration files and implement secure settings. 
<br>
<br>
Overall, focus on secure imlementations of configuration files, both in preparation and during competition.

### Dealing with harder vulnerabilties

It is natural to get to a point where all the easy stuff is gone and you're stuck. My tip with dealing with harder vulnerabilities is to.... NOT DO THEM!
<br>
Now I dont mean that you should stop competing and go eat some pizza when you're stuck. Definitely not.
<br>
My point is, even though you "finished" the easy stuff, you did not finish the east stuff. There is always stuff you missing or security contorls you put in place wrong.
<br>
Always go make and ENSURE you did everything PERFECTLY. 
<br>
<br>
Now the real tips for dealing with harder vulnerabilties is to just take your time. Try and find some clues that lead to the fact that something is vulnerable. Once you follow the trail, execute and eliminate the vulnerability. 
<br>
Also don't worry about perfection, take your time and you will succeed.
